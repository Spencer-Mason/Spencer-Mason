## Hi, I'm Spencer Mason.

I am a full-stack junior developer and a recent graduate of The Tech Academy's Software Developer Bootcamp. I'm trained in many aspects of development, including but not limited to: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Python, C#, SQL, MVC, along with several frameworks.<br>
My training also included two internships, where I learned how to work with a team utilizing DevOps and Agile/Scrum methodology. Learning and figuring things out is my strong suite, so if you're using technology I'm not already familiar with I know I can learn it with not much trouble at all.<br>
I can guarantee I would be an asset to any team.
